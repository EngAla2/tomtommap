It is worth noting that by using our help, you avoid making mistakes and extra calls\n * to the service.\n *\n * We provide three different bundles of the library:\n *\n * - __services-web.min.js__ - use this file if you want to include the library directly on a web page,\n * it can be imported in the `<head>` of your HTML document.\n * The `tt` global object  will be created and attached to the `window`.\n * - __services.min.js__ - use this file if you are using a module bundler. It conforms the\n * <a target=\"_blank\" rel=”noopener” href=\"https://github.com/umdjs/umd\">UMD standard</a>.\n * In case you use ES6 imports all you need is: <br/>`import tt from 'services.min.js'`\n * - __services-node.min.js__ - use this file if you want to use our services in Node.js.\n *\n * <div class=\"alert alert-info margin-top-16\">\n * If you want to display a map on the webpage, go to\n * {{#crossLinkModule \"Maps\"}}Maps library documentation{{/crossLinkModule}}.\n *  </div>\n *\n * <h3 id=\"difference_between_api_responses_and_this_librarys_responses\">Difference\n * between API responses and this library's responses</h3>\n * _Services library_ provides an easy way to get responses from APIs like\n * <a href=\"https://developer.tomtom.com/search-api/search-api-documentation\"\n * target=\"_blank\" rel=”noopener”>Search API</a>,\n * <a href=\"https://developer.tomtom.com/routing-api/routing-api-documentation\"\n * target=\"_blank\" rel=”noopener”>Routing API</a>\n * or <a href=\"https://developer.tomtom.com/traffic-api/traffic-api-documentation\"\n * target=\"_blank\" rel=”noopener”>Traffic API</a>.\n * In order to maintain consistency between data types returned by those APIs, and\n * to make it more convenient to use those responses and data types with the\n * {{#crossLinkModule \"Maps\"}}Maps library{{/crossLinkModule}}, **_Services library_ alters\n * original responses**:\n * * point representations like `[lat, lon]`, `'lat, lon'`, `{lon, lat}`, `{latitude, longitude}`, `{x, y}`\n * are mapped to `{lng, lat}` Object type.\n * * some services responses are extended by additional methods like `toGeoJson()`\n * ({{#crossLink \"Services.services.calculateRoute\"}}calculateRoute{{/crossLink}},\n * {{#crossLink \"Services.services.calculateReachableRange\"}}calculateReachableRange{{/crossLink}},\n * {{#crossLink \"Services.services.incidentDetails\"}}incidentDetails{{/crossLink}},\n * {{#crossLink \"Services.services.alongRouteSearch\"}}alongRouteSearch{{/crossLink}},\n * {{#crossLink \"Services.services.placeById\"}}placeById{{/crossLink}},\n * {{#crossLink \"Services.services.fuzzySearch\"}}fuzzySearch{{/crossLink}},\n * {{#crossLink \"Services.services.geometrySearch\"}}geometrySearch{{/crossLink}},\n * {{#crossLink \"Services.services.nearbySearch\"}}nearbySearch{{/crossLink}},\n * {{#crossLink \"Services.services.categorySearch\"}}categorySearch{{/crossLink}},\n * {{#crossLink \"Services.services.poiSearch\"}}poiSearch{{/crossLink}},\n * {{#crossLink \"Services.services.structuredGeocode\"}}structuredGeocode{{/crossLink}},\n * {{#crossLink \"Services.services.geocode\"}}geocode{{/crossLink}}).\n\n * Usage of this method is presented on the documentation page of each service mentioned.\n * * The `getTrackingId()` method is also available as part of the service response\n * in order to obtain the `Tracking-ID` associated with the request.\n *\n * Most services are asynchronous and return\n * <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\"\n * target=\"_blank\" rel=”noopener”>Promise</a>\n * except for {{#crossLink \"Services.services.staticImage\"}}staticImage{{/crossLink}} and\n * {{#crossLink \"Services.services.poiPhotos\"}}poiPhotos{{/crossLink}}, which return URL string.\n *\n * @module Services\n * @main Services\n */\n\n/**\n * This object aggregates all the services available in TomTom.\n *\n * Please refer to the following documentation to check what properties are on the tt object,\n * and how you can make calls to TomTom services.\n *\n * @class tt\n * @namespace Services\n */\n\n/**\n * @property services\n * @type services\n * @description An object, which contains all supported services.\n */\n\n/**\n * @method sdkInfo\n * @type function\n * @description Returns SDK details (e.g., version).\n * @return {Object}\n */\n\n/**\n * @method setProductInfo\n * @type function\n * @description This method sets the content of the TomTom-User-Agent header.
